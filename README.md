We have created a dashboard to display the analysis of stock market. The technologies that we have used are HTML, CSS and Java Script.
For visualization of the data provided to us in json format, we have used Pandas, Data frames, Python and plotly library.
INSTRUCTIONS to be followed to run the code on you local machines are as follows:-
1. Download all the files and images specified in the same folder.
2. df = pd.read_json("<Provide the path for the json file from your drive folder>"). 
3. For example - df = pd.read_json("/content/drive/MyDrive/Northern Trust/Copy of Stock List.json"). 
4. Open the dashboard by clicking on the HTML file in your Web browser.
5. From the drop down Menu in the Search option, choose your preference and see the desired visual representation of the chosen company's data.
  
 Technologies which can be used to enhance the experience of the user:-
 1.  Html, CSS, JavaScript can be used to design a website which offers sentiment analysis of a stock.
 2.  AngularJS can be used to create an efficient user-website interface in case we provide advisory options or stock trading options on the website.
 3.  To plot graphs dynamically data analytical tools like python libraries (pandas, matplotlib) are helpful
 4.  To store client history, we can link our frontend code with a database like mySQL.
 5.  We can incorporate backend languages like Java to perform search operations and JDBC to link the code with the database.
